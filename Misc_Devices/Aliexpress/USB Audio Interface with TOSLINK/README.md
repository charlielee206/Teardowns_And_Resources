## USB C Audio Interface with Optical TOSLINK input and Output

</br>

Okay, I honestly have No idea what this is a knock-off of. </br>
I needed a optical S/PDIF input for my PC, This was one of the first results from Aliexpress, and it didn't work. At least not the optical input.</br>
The mics and headphone slots work, at least.</br>
If you need one of these, you can find one of these on Aliexpress by searching "USB C Audio Interface with Optical TOSLINK".</br>
They come in black and blue. Possibly more colours.
