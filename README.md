# Teardowns_And_Resources
Photos and Info on cheap stuff from amazon that I rip apart</br></br>
More often than I thought, I needed to know what chip/part was inside a device. Teardowns of high-end(?) electronic devices sould be found at palces like ifixit, But I could not find any resources for random cheap electronic devoces from amazon/aliexpress/whatever. And I was sick of scrubbing through low resolution youtube videos, trying to figure out what was whay. </br>
So I made a place where I could compile all the random stuff I tear apart. Mabye useful to another fellow armchair reverse-engineer like me. </br>Hope this helps.
